# Discord Bot

This project is a Discord bot designed for handling commands and interactions within a Discord server. It is built using JavaScript and Node.js, with the Discord.js library. The bot's primary function is to provide the rules of the Discord server when users use the `/rules` command. The rules are displayed in a paged-embed format. When the last page is reached, a "verify" button appears to allow users to verify themselves, granting complete access to the server, and the embeds reset.
